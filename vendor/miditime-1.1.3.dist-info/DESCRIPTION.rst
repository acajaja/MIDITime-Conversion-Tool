It's MIDITime!
==============

Do you have time time series data you want to play as music? Of course
you do!

MIDITime converts any kind of time series data into pitch, velocity and
duration values based on musical options that you set up, then outputs a
.mid file.

MIDI files aren't technically audio -- they're instructions on how
software instruments should be played. You can either play .mid files
directly in some music applications, or import them into a wide variety
of music editors (like ProTools, Ableton, MaxMSP) and add a ton of bells
and whistles to get broadcast-ready audio.

We used MIDITime to produce the data sonification in `this episode of
Reveal <https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/power-struggle-the-perilous-price-of-americas-energy-boom/#segment-oklahomas-man-made-earthquakes>`__.
The musical track -- without the talking -- `is

Installing
----------

.. code:: python

    pip install miditime

Usage
-----

Very basic:
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from miditime.miditime import MIDITime

    # Instantiate the class with a tempo (120bpm is the default) and an output file destination.
    mymidi = MIDITime(120, 'myfile.mid')

    # Create a list of notes. Each note is a list: [time, pitch, velocity, duration]
    midinotes = [
        [0, 60, 127, 3],  #At 0 beats (the start), Middle C with velocity 127, for 3 beats
        [10, 61, 127, 4]  #At 10 beats (12 seconds from start), C#5 with velocity 127, for 4 beats
    ]

    # Add a track with those notes
    mymidi.add_track(midinotes)

    # Output the .mid file
    mymidi.save_midi()

A little more fun, a lot more control:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instantiate the class with a tempo (120bpm is the default), an output
file destination, the number of seconds you want to represent a year in
the final song (default is 5 sec/year), the base octave (C5 is middle C,
so the default is 5, and how many octaves you want your output to range
over (default is 1).

.. code:: python

    from miditime.miditime import MIDITime
    mymidi = MIDITime(120, 'myfile.mid', 5, 5, 1)

Bring in some data (this is some earthquakes). I'm assuming your data is
already in date order, from oldest to newest.

.. code:: python

    my_data = [
        {'event_date': <datetime object>, 'magnitude': 3.4},
        {'event_date': <datetime object>, 'magnitude': 3.2},
        {'event_date': <datetime object>, 'magnitude': 3.6},
        {'event_date': <datetime object>, 'magnitude': 3.0},
        {'event_date': <datetime object>, 'magnitude': 5.6},
        {'event_date': <datetime object>, 'magnitude': 4.0}
    ]

Convert your date/time data into an integer, like days since the epoch
(Jan. 1, 1970). You can use the days\_since\_epoch() helper method, or
not:

.. code:: python

    my_data_epoched = [{'days_since_epoch': mymidi.days_since_epoch(d['event_date']), 'magnitude': d['magnitude']} for d in my_data]

Convert your integer date/time to something reasonable for a song. For
example, at 120 beats per minute, you'll need to scale the data down a
lot to avoid a very long song if your data spans years. This uses the
seconds\_per\_year attribute you set at the top, so if your date is
converted to something other than days you may need to do your own
conversion. But if your dataset spans years and your dates are in days
(with fractions is fine), use the beat() helper method.

.. code:: python

    my_data_timed = [{'beat': mymidi.beat(d['days_since_epoch']), 'magnitude': d['magnitude']} for d in my_data_epoched]

Get the earliest date in your series so you can set that to 0 in the
MIDI:

.. code:: python

    start_time = my_data_timed[0]['beat']

Set up some functions to scale your other variable (magnitude in our
case) to match your desired mode/key and octave range. There are helper
methods to assist this scaling, very similar to a charting library like
D3. You can choose a linear or logarithmic scale.

.. code:: python

    def mag_to_pitch_tuned(magnitude):
        # Where does this data point sit in the domain of your data? (I.E. the min magnitude is 3, the max in 5.6). In this case the optional 'True' means the scale is reversed, so the highest value will return the lowest percentage.
        scale_pct = mymidi.linear_scale_pct(3, 5.7, magnitude)

        # Another option: Linear scale, reverse order
        # scale_pct = mymidi.linear_scale_pct(3, 5.7, magnitude, True)

        # Another option: Logarithmic scale, reverse order
        # scale_pct = mymidi.log_scale_pct(3, 5.7, magnitude, True)

        # Pick a range of notes. This allows you to play in a key.
        c_major = ['C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A', 'B']

        #Find the note that matches your data point
        note = mymidi.scale_to_note(scale_pct, c_major)

        #Translate that note to a MIDI pitch
        midi_pitch = mymidi.note_to_midi_pitch(note)

        return midi_pitch

Now build your note list

.. code:: python

    note_list = []

    for d in my_data_timed:
        note_list.append([
            d['beat'] - start_time,
            mag_to_pitch_tuned(d['magnitude']),
            100,  # velocity
            1  # duration, in beats
        ])

And finish

.. code:: python

    # Add a track with those notes
    mymidi.add_track(note_list)

    # Output the .mid file
    mymidi.save_midi()

There are many programs to work with MIDI, but
`timidity <http://sourceforge.net/projects/timidity/>`__ (installable
with apt) is a simple command-line one if you just want to hear what you
hath wrought.

if you credited Reveal and Michael Corey somehow if you use this to make

MIDITime is a wrapper around the actual midi-making hotness of
`midiutil <https://github.com/duggan/midiutil>`__, produced by `Mark
Conway Wirt <http://www.emergentmusics.org/site-information>`__. I have
included midiutil in this package `per his
